However, due to his body not being suited to Water Breathing's techniques, Tanjiro decided to switch to the Hinokami Kagura as his main Breathing Style.<br /><br />Hinokami Kagura :  During his near-death experience in his battle with Rui, Tanjiro awakened this in a memory of his father teaching him this Breathing Style. As his body was more suited to the Hinokami Kagura, he quickly overpowered the Lower Rank demon.

        abilities:<h4><p>From the beginning, Zenitsu comes off as a talented and skilled Demon Slayer though he denies this. His strength awakens when he is asleep as his nervous demeanour is what normally keeps him from accessing his abilities, making him more sagacious, calm and precise in combat. This allowed him to instantly decapitate the Tongue Demon and defeat Son of the Spider Family by himself. He was later able to defend 3 entire train carts being under attack by Enmu, Lower Rank One, along with Nezuko. </p> <p> Unconscious Combat: Zenitsu has the ability to fight when he sleeps, which allows him to awaken his true strength. While awake, his nerves and fear cause him to freeze up so he cannot move. When his life is in danger, his nerves and fear grow so strong that he passes out. But while asleep, his nerves are no longer holding him back, allowing him to fight and move with great judgement, precision and skill. His hearing also places a big part in allowing Zenitsu to fight unconsciously, as it enables him to discern his surroundings and the location of his enemies and their attacks. This also allows him to fight even after he falls victim to Enmu's spell that makes anyone go into deep sleep.</p></h4>,

Inosuke is more than capable of hunting and slaying demons on his own, as he easily killed the Horned Demon without any trouble.
