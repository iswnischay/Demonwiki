He is the Demon King, the first of his kind, and the progenitor of all other demons in existence.</p> <p>Muzan is also the leader of the Twelve Kizuki, an organization of the twelve strongest demons in existence that serve directly under him.</p></h4>,
       abilities:<h4><p>Overall Abilities: As the Demon King, the first and the progenitor of his kind, Muzan is the strongest demon in existence. Even after dissolving a drug that was supposed to weaken his powers and turn him back into a human, Muzan easily annihilated close to a hundred Demon Slayers in a short period of time effortlessly. In his bout with a marked Giyu Tomioka and Tanjiro Kamado, the former stated that an Upper Rank's strength is incomparable to Muzan's, while the latter was unable to even follow his attacks and could only dodge by pure instinct. After Tanjiro got close to the Demon King, Muzan nonchalantly slashed out Tanjiro's eye, and later stated that his attacks were too fast for him to detect through smell.</p></h4>,
       BloodDemonArt:<h4><p>Biokinesis: Muzan's Blood Demon Art grants him powerful biokinetic abilities, most prominently the ability to manipulate his body at will and shapeshift instantly. Though all demons have the innate ability to manipulate their flesh, Muzan takes it to a new level, possessing the ability to change his appearance, flesh, and organs at an unparalleled level of speed and precision. This was first shown during the Lower Rank meeting where he took on the appearance and aura of an adult female which fooled the Lower Moons. He later contorted his left arm into a large, grotesque, and monstrous form with numerous mouths and eyes, which he used to kill and consume the Lower Ranks. Afterwards, Muzan uses this ability to take on the appearance of a child to attain a new disguise amongst humans, even selectively shifting the color of his eyes when talking to Akaza.</p></h4>,

        abilities:<h4><p>Overall Abilities: Despite not being a member of the Twelve Kizuki, Nezuko is a very powerful demon. Her most prominent trait is her extraordinary growth rate, possibly due to the high amount of blood she received from Muzan Kibutsuji when he turned Nezuko into a demon and the fact that she doesn't need to consume human blood to survive. This was shown across many battles in the course of the series where she could defeat her enemies despite being overwhelmed by them in the beginning. She has shown to defeat her enemies by increasing her own physical capabilities, enhancing her regeneration, or developing her own Blood Demon Art in dire situations.</p></h4>,
        BloodDemonArt:<h4><p>Pyrokinesis: Nezuko's Blood Demon Art allows her to generate and manipulate special demonic flames created from her blood that are pinkish in color. Her flames have a special property which makes it only harmful to demons and objects of demon origin while being completely harmless to humans and other objects. This was shown when her fire could burn Rui's threads, Enmu's dream spell, Daki's body, Hantengu's manifestations of emotion, and Genya Shinazugawa who had consumed demons but unable to affect Tanjiro and the Mugen Train. These flames of purification have been noted to hamper the regeneration of demons to an extent too, as shown with Daki's sustained burns took much longer to heal than traditional wounds, needing to heal with aid from her brother's stronger healing.</p></h4>,

       abilities:<h4><p>Overall Abilities: Despite not displaying much in terms of fighting ability, as the holder of the fourth highest position in the Twelve Kizuki, Nakime is nonetheless an extremely powerful demon. She was capable of using her unorthodox Blood Demon Art to thwart the efforts of Obanai and Mitsuri at beheading her and stall the two Hashira for most of the Infinity Castle Arc, with neither of the two skilled combatants being able to so much as scratch her.</p></h4>,
       BloodDemonArt:<h4><p>Infinity Castle: Nakime's Blood Demon Art takes the form of an extra-dimensional space that houses a fortress of immense scale. As its owner, Nakime possesses absolute dominion over the space, being able to manipulate and alter it at will by simply strumming her biwa. In her fortress, there are countless rooms with seemingly endless variety, like an open room filled with giant pillars where the fight against Kokushibo took place; a small garden where the fight against Doma took place; a corridor leading to several other rooms where the fight against Akaza took place. Nakime sits at the center of the Infinity Castle, with the entire space being distorted around her.</p></h4>,

       Nearly five centuries ago during the Sengoku Era, Kokushibo was a human by the name of Michikatsu Tsugikuni , a former Demon Slayer, and the older twin brother of Yoriichi Tsugikuni, the strongest Demon Slayer that had ever existed.</p></h4>,
       abilities:<h4><p>Overall Abilities: As the highest ranking member of the Twelve Kizuki, Kokushibo is an extraordinarily powerful demon, second only to the Demon King Muzan Kibutsuji himself. He has battled countless Demon Slayers and has amassed vast experience and knowledge over his near 500-year long life. His abilities have been refined to the highest level as he is not only a master of Total Concentration Breathing, but also a marked individual who has gained access to the Transparent World, as well as the demon that possesses the highest concentration of Muzan's blood in the organization.</p></h4>,
       BloodDemonArt:<h4><p>Crescent Moon Blades: Complementing his combat style: Moon Breathing, his Blood Demon Art allows him to create and manipulate dozens of sharp blades shaped like traditional crescent moons from his flesh katana.[57] They are implied to be created from his blood and can be either a bright yellow or a bright blue in color.[60][61] These crescent moon blades are extremely chaotic, constantly changing in size, length and speed, making Kokushibo's attacks extremely unpredictable and unreadable as they have no set pattern.This Blood Demon Art greatly enhances the power of his techniques, making every single one of his sword swings extremely deadly and dangerous. He also seems to be capable of using his Blood Demon Art as long as his katana is unsheathed, allowing him to create crescent moon blades even without swinging his sword or unleashing a technique.[63] The volatile nature of his Blood Demon Art makes it extremely challenging for Demon Slayers to circumvent. Sanemi stated that if not for his years of experience in the field of demon hunting, he wouldn't have been able to defend himself from Kokushibo's attacks.</p></h4>,

    Over a century ago, Doma held the position of Upper Rank Six , and during that tenure, he turned Gyutaro and Daki into demons and introduced them into the Twelve Kizuki.</p><p>
    
    He is also the leader of the Eternal Paradise Faith, a cult dedicated to worshipping Doma and a place where he listens to all his followers' troubles and gives them advice. It also acts as a place for Doma to capture and kill humans. This cult also took in Inosuke Hashibira's mother, Kotoha Hashibira, before Doma killed her for finding out that he was eating his followers.</p></h4>,
    abilities:<h4><p>Overall Abilities: As the holder of the second highest position in the Twelve Kizuki, Doma is an exceptionally powerful demon, being the second highest ranking member in the Twelve Kizuki and the third strongest demon in existence. His combination of combative prowess and his potent cryokinetic Blood Demon Art in battle is powerful enough to overwhelm and defeat the Insect Hashira, Shinobu Kocho, without any difficulty, and he is also noted to have defeated Kanae Kocho, the late Flower Hashira, in the past. Afterwards, Doma could take on both Inosuke and Kanao, who were on par with the Hashira, simultaneously without much effort either.</p></h4>,
    BloodDemonArt:<h4><p>Cryokinesis: Doma's Blood Demon Art grants him extremely powerful cryokinesis. He can generate ice and frost from his flesh and blood and can spawn it anywhere in his vicinity, as well as manipulating it at will, allowing him to unleash incredibly potent ice techniques. Additionally, the ice created from his Blood Demon Art is extremely lethal to those that inhale it, causing the cells of the victim's lungs to die and rendering them unable to breathe very quickly. His ice and frost has also been noted to be extremely cold, as shown when the air around Doma's frost was cold enough to make Shinobu's lungs feel as if they were about to burst and nearly freeze Kanao's body and surroundings just by coming into contact with it.</p></h4>,

Akaza possesses incredible abilities and attributes, most notably his martial arts prowess, which can outmatch the swordsmanship of even the most skilled Demon Slayers, and his ability to sense Fighting Spirit  which allows him to predict his opponent's attacks and discern their</p></h4>,

The shockwaves Akaza manipulates are blue in color and can take on many forms, such as nigh-invisible air pressure, circular energy-like shockwaves, or cannon-shaped spikes. He is capable of generating them at will, from any distance, and seemingly from any part of his body. In combat, Akaza has his shockwaves accompany his own punches and kicks to amplify its destructive capabilities, enveloping his every strike in a faint blue light.</p></h4>,
